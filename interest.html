      <h3>Interests</h3>
      Outside of work and study I like to divide my time between many different activities. I enjoy spending time with
      my partner, family and friends, either hanging out, playing board games and trivia or watching movies. I like to unwind
      myself by watching various movies, TV shows and reading. I also have a long running interest in many different
      sports and sports teams.

      <h4>Movies</h4>
      <p>
        There is a broad range of movie genres I enjoy, from Sci-Fi and Fantasy to Action and Drama to Musicals and Rom-coms.
        Some of my favourite movies are:
        <ul>
          <li>Ex Machina</li>
          <li>Star Wars</li>
          <li>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</li>
          <li>Harry Potter Series</li>
          <li>Batman Trilogy</li>
          <li>Marvel Cinematic Universe</li>
          <li>The Shawshank Redemption</li>
          <li>Inception</li>
          <li>The Intouchables</li>
          <li>The Prestige</li>
          <li>Into the Spider Verse</li>
          <li>Warrior</li>
          <li>The Greatest Showman</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>TV Shows</h4>
      <p>
        I am quite selective about the TV shows I watch as there is a much bigger commitment involved. If I start a show unless
        its terrible I will watch all the way to the end. Some of my favourites include:
        <ul>
          <li>Game of Thrones</li>
          <li>Westworld</li>
          <li>Parks and Rec</li>
          <li>New Girl</li>
          <li>Arrow</li>
          <li>Blackadder</li>
          <li>Peaky Blinders</li>
          <li>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</li>
          <li>Drive to Survive</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Books</h4>
      <p>
        My choice of book will usually range between fantacy or non-fiction. When I go non-fiction it is usually related to
        science, history or real world issues. Some of my favourite books are:
        <ul>
          <li>The Licanius Trilogy By James Islington</li>
          <li>The Stormlight Archive By Brandon Sanderson</li>
          <li>A Song of Ice and Fire By George R.R. Martin</li>
          <li>The Brief History of Everyone Who Every Lived By Adam Rutherford</li>
          <li>Homo Deus By Yuval Noah Harari</li>
          <li>The Priory of the Orange Tree By Samantha Shannon</li>
          <li>The Black Count By Reiss</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Sports</h4>
      <p>
        As a young kid growing up in England there was only one sport I was every interested in, Soccer! Upon moving to
        Australia I developed an interest in other sports such as cricket, basketball, AFL, Rugby League and Formula 1.
        The teams I currently follow are Newcastle United (soccer), Chicago Bulls (basketball), England cricket team,
        Collingwood Football Club (AFL) and Mercedes (F1).
      </p>

      <h4>Board Games</h4>
      <p>
        In my family we have grown up playing board games. Along with a number of friends that are the same experience, we
        regularly play board games together. Some of my favourites that I recommend are:
        <ul>
          <li>Articulate</li>
          <li>Settlers of Catan</li>
          <li>Pandemic</li>
          <li>Colditz</li>
          <li>Secret Hitler</li>
          <li>Bananagrams</li>
          <li>What we simply call "The Game" (probably a new for it out there somewhere)</li>
          <li>Hanabi</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
