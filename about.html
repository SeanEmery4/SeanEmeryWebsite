      <h4>Currently</h4>
      <p>
        Currently completing a Computer Science degree at Deakin University, Melbourne,
        in my second year. I have completed units related to data science, discrete maths,
        basic C++ programs, object orient programs with C#, embedded systems and working
        professionally in agile teams.

        Future units will involve networks, robotics, AI, data structures, algorithms, machine learning,
        constraint programming and programming paradigms as well as industry placement and a capstone
        project.
      </p>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
        I have a background in the electrical industry, starting my working life as an electrician in the commercial industry.
        I spent over 4 years in this role working on large apartment blocks, hospitals and research centres. From
        here I undertook an Advanced Diploma in electrical enginerring at Victoria Polytechnic. Upon completion
        I began working as an electrical engineer within the industrial industry for 2 years. Working closely with
        the software and controls team, it was here I developed more of an interest in software and decided I wanted
        to learn this skill.
      </p>

      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p>
        Once I have completed my bachelors degree I would like to begin building a career within the industry.
        With my background I feel the area that suits me most is working with embedded systems with IoT devices or robotics.
        I would like to develop software that controls components in the physical world such as motors.

        While this is my main focus, the reason I decided to go with computer science as a degree was to experience
        different aspects from within the industry. My studies so far have opened me up to data science in the modern world
        with so much information being collect and stored. This is also an area I find I have a great deal of interest in.

        Going forward in my studies I am looking forward to learning how networks work and AI. These are also potential career
        paths for me if I find to content enjoyable.
