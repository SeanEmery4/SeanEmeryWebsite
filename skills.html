      <h4>Programming</h4>
      <p>
        Across my studies so far both at university and in my own time, I have worked with many different
        programming languages. My ability with these languages vary from writing basic scripts to developing more
        complex programs.

      <h4>Drafting</h4>
      <p>
        Through studying Electrical Engineering at Victoria Polytechnic I began learnign to draft.
        Within this course we were taught how to use AutoCAD. Since then I have further developed this
        skill within the industry. I have create new drawings and modified exsiting ones. I have experience
        with electrical layouts and electrical schematics.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>Electrical</h4>
      <p>
        Beginning my work life as an Electrician I have developed a good understanding of electrical systems
        acorss the last 10 years. I began by readings plans and wiring installations to those specifications provided.
        I then moved on to providing plans and drawings based on specifications provided by more experienced members
        of the team. My latest full time role involed designing installations myself based on client specifications and
        providing team members with these designs. I am also a fully qualified, A grade Electrican in the state of Victoria.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>Problem Solving & Critical Thinking</h4>
      <p>
        Overcoming problems has been central to my work and study up to this point. As an Electrician, when
        the method I would usually use wasn't possible I would need to find a way to overcome this. When designing
        electrical installations it is very rare that everything lines up perfectly and there is no problems to
        overcome. Coming up against these issues has enabled me to become very comfortable with solving problems.

        This has been developed further throughout my degree and other studies. University course work is often
        created with problem solving in mind to develop students ability to first identify issues and then overcome
        them. I have found my ability to solve problems has result in good outcomes from my degree so far and have
        developed a good technique to tackle problems with.

        Across work and studies I have also developed my critical thinking. Being able to look at a potential solution
        and see why it may not work before implementation saves time and resources. This links closly with problem solving
        as in order to first identify a problem we need to be able to see it. I can often see issues before they become
        one, which enables much easier rectification.
      </p>

      <h4>Time & Self Managment</h4>
      <p>
        From a young age I have always made myself aware of the due date and estimating how long a task would take.
        This skill has been beneficial in my life in that I know where a task should be up to at various times and
        am able to put more time in if I need to before the due date starts to loom. This skill has been further developed
        in work and university. When being given a project at work I first find out when it is due and then look at
        the workload to gage how much time will need to be spent on it. From here I can work out when I need to
        start the project and if I am able to take on extra work on top of it.

        In university, these skills become even more valuable. Having to juggle many unconnected units with course work
        and assignments is not an easy task. Managing my self throughout the week has become second nature to ensure
        I am dedicating enough time to my studies and allowing myself to live outside of that. This involves being aware
        of every assignment due date within the semester and fitting those in around weekly classes.

        I pride myself on these two skills, which has enabled me to never miss a due date and in the vast majority of
        cases have the work completed with at least a week to spare.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>Team Work</h4>
      <p>
        Across my working and personal life it is hard to find a time in which I wasn't working in a team. Team work has
        been a essential in my life at almost every stage. As a child I played team sports up until my mid twenties, with
        some very successful teams. As an Electrician I was always a part of a team to get the job done on time and to
        a high standard. Moving into the Electrical Engineering role required being part of the software team and
        working with other teams to produce machines for the food and beverage industry.

        As team work has been a constant aspect within my life, I have developed into an excellent team member. I am
        quick to find where my skills can be best utilised within the team and always conscious of how my work (both
        quality and duration) affects different team members and the outcome as a whole. From my perspective, one
        of the most important aspects of working within a team is communication, which is a skill I have developed
        to a high level over many years.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4>Mentoring</h4>
      <p>
        Helping others who are less experienced than me has always been an area I have enjoyed. Within sports teams
        I have been in various leadership and senior positions. I was captain of a championship winning team and
        have been in leadership groups for many seasons. Here I developed an ability to bring new players in to the
        team environment in a positive manner.

        I also spend a semster working in the student help hub at my university which involed helping students
        struggling with writing code. I enjoyed being able to pass on my knowledge to people who it didn't come
        as naturally to.
